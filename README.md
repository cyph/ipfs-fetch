# IPFS Fetch

Simple no-fuss Node.js module for fetching data from IPFS.

This is actively maintained and used in production, but isn't being developed with bells and whistles that we don't need from it internally at this time (e.g. TypeScript type definition). If you need to add something, feel free to send a pull request.
